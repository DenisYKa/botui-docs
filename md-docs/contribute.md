2. Clone the forked repo `git clone ...` and then `cd botui-docs`
3. Do an `npm install`
4. Run `npm install -g docpress` to install `docpress` globally. It is what makes the docs.
5. Run `docpress serve` inside `botui-docs` folder. Now you should be able to see the docs on `http://localhost:3000`.

All the documentation is written in markdown markup inside `md-docs` folder. Means these are the files you should be writing in.

Once you are done contributing, `commit`, `push` and then create a pull request. Your changes will be live on docs site once your changes are pulled and merged to repo.
